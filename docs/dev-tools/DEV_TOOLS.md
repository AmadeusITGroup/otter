# Otter utils library

The Otter Framework provides a collection of tools to help your Otter's project maintenance.

## Artifactory Tools

There are tools for the supported repository manager [JFrog](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/), including deleting old artifacts and deleting a specified amount of PR build artifacts.

Further information on these tools can be found in the `@o3r/artifactory-tools` package [documentation](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/otter/blob/main/packages/%40o3r/artifactory-tools/README.md).

## Azure Tools

There is also a tool to comment a Pull Request on Azure.

Further information on this tool can be found in the `@o3r/azure-tools` package [documentation](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/otter/blob/main/packages/%40o3r/azure-tools/README.md).
