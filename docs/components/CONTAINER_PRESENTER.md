# Container / Presenter

We encourage developers to decouple components into containers and presenters. From a UI perspective it is a good practice to separate access of Data/ business logic form pure presentation, this allows developer to reuse presenters in other parts of the code with different data or having a container linked to multiple presenters, in case you want to display the same thing with a totally different user experience.

## Implementation of the pattern

A component implementing the container/presenter pattern is split into two Angular components: the container and the presenter.

It should have a global _index.ts_ module file.

### Container

The container is located in the _container_ folder of the component.

It must implement the template outlet pattern in order to get the ability to customise the presentation layer.

It must have a dedicated presenter component which will orchestrate the presentation.

It should follow the following naming convention:

| Attribute        | Pattern           |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| **Component file name**      | *-cont.component.ts |
| **Selector name**      | *-cont |
| **Component name**      | *ContComponent |
| **Configuration file name**      | *-cont.config.ts |
| **Configuration name**      | *ContConfig |
| **Context file name**      | *-cont.context.ts |
| **Context interface names**      | *ContContextInput / *ContContextOutput / *ContContext |
| **Fixture file name**      | *-cont.fixture.ts |
| **Fixture name**      | 	*ContFixture |
| **Module file name**      | *-cont.module.ts |
| **Module name**      | *ContModule |
| **Template file name**      | *-cont.template.html |
| **Unit test file name**      | *-cont.spec.ts |

It has its own _index.ts_ file exporting:

* Module file
* Context file
* Configuration file

### Presenter

The presenter is located in the _presenter_ folder of the component..

It should follow the following naming convention:

| Attribute        | Pattern           |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| **Component file name**      | *-pres.component.ts |
| **Selector name**      | *-pres |
| **Component name**      | *PresComponent |
| **Configuration file name**      | *-pres.config.ts |
| **Configuration name**      | *PresConfig |
| **Context file name**      | *-pres.context.ts |
| **Context interface names**      | *PresContextInput / *PresContextOutput / *PresContext |
| **Fixture file name**      | *-pres.fixture.ts |
| **Fixture name**      | 	*PresFixture |
| **Module file name**      | *-pres.module.ts |
| **Module name**      | *PresModule |
| **Template file name**      | *-pres.template.html |
| **Style file name**      | *-pres.style.scss |
| **Unit test file name**      | *-pres.spec.ts |

It has its own _index.ts_ file exporting:

* Module file
* Context file
* Configuration file

### Example

Example of a component implementing the container/presenter pattern:

```
passengers/
    container/
        passengers-cont.component.ts
        passengers-cont.module.ts
        passengers-cont.template.html
        passengers-cont.config.ts
        passengers-cont.context.ts
        passengers-cont.spec.ts
        index.ts
    contracts/
        passenger.model.ts
    directives/
        my-directive.directive.ts
    presenter/
        passengers-pres.component.ts
        passengers-pres.module.ts
        passengers-pres.template.html
        passengers-pres.style.scss
        passengers-pres.style.theme.scss
        passengers-pres.config.ts
        passengers-pres.context.ts
        passengers-pres.fixture.ts
        passengers-pres.spec.ts
        index.ts
    sub-components/
        my-sub-component/
    index.ts
```

## Guidelines summary

* A component interacting with external entities (store, services, etc.) should be split into a container and a presenter
* A component with no interactions with external entities should only be a presenter
* By definition, a block is always split into container/presenter
* Sub-components are located in the related block sub-components folder. If the sub-component is a block, it will then be set either in the components root folder (if it has a functional meaning), or at the root of the functional folder in a dedicated sub folder.
* A component shared among different blocks and hosted in the same functional folder, should be placed in a shared folder under the functional one.
* Avoid creating useless intermediate folder:
    * A component with only a presenter and no container should not have a presenter folder
    * A functional area containing only one block should not have a sub-folder for it
