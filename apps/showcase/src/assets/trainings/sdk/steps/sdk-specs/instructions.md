The first step in the generation of an SDK is the definition of the specifications. These can be written in a file of type JSON or YAML.

The <a href="https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/otter/tree/main/packages/%40o3r-training/showcase-sdk" target="_blank">Otter Showcase SDK</a> has been created with the
<a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore/blob/master/src/main/resources/openapi.yaml" target="_blank">specifications</a> made available by the
<a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore" target="_blank">Swagger Petstore</a> repository.
You can find these specifications in the `openapi.yml` file of the repository.

### Objective
The goal of this exercise is to get a basic understanding of the format of the specifications.

### Exercise
You can get to know the provided Swagger Petstore specifications and eventually copy them in order to generate your own SDK locally, which will be explained in the next part.

To become familiar with the specifications format, you can also use the <a href="https://editor-next.swagger.io/" target="_blank">Swagger Editor</a> tool.\
*(You can find the Swagger Petstore specifications by selecting **File** at the top of the page, then **Load Example** and selecting one of the OpenAPI
Petstore examples, depending on the OpenAPI version you wish to target.)*
