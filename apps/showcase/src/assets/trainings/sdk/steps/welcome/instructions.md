This interactive tutorial will teach you how to generate and use an SDK using the Otter framework.

### How to use this tutorial
This tutorial is composed of several steps, including:
1. How to use the Otter SDK?
2. Customize your fetch client with plugins
3. Integrate your SDK in Angular
4. Generate your first SDK - Specifications
5. Generate your first SDK - Command
6. SDK with Dates - How to use
7. SDK with Dates - Generation
8. SDK with model extension

We will cover explanations on these topics along with examples and exercises for better understanding.

### Instructions for exercises
Each step covers a concept of the Otter SDK and can be done independently.

To navigate between the steps, you can use the arrows or the drop-down menu at the top right of the page.

Most of the exercises can be done in the integrated code editor (except for the generation of an SDK, which should be done locally).
Each step's objective and exercise will be described in the instructions, and you can check out your results in the **Preview** tab. 
You can also check out the **Output** tab for the console. You can interact with the console and run commands in the **Terminal** tab.

When a solution is available, you can reveal the answer by clicking on the **Show Solution** button at the top right of the page.

### Prerequisites
You will need some familiarity with HTML and Typescript to understand the exercises.

We are trying to make our training as accessible as possible, but for the best experience we recommend getting familiar with OpenAPI
before starting the exercises.

#### Environment
For the exercises that need to be done locally, your environment requires:
- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs" target="_blank">Node</a> - Version 18.0.0 or above - minimum required version according to the <a href="https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/otter/blob/main/packages/%40ama-sdk/schematics/package.json" target="_blank">&#64;ama-sdk/schematics package</a>
- <a href="https://adoptium.net/" target="_blank">Java</a> _(for SDK generation)_ - Version 11 or above - minimum required version according to <a href="https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator" target="_blank">OpenAPI Generator</a>

### Resources
We will refer to some OpenAPI concepts throughout this training when explaining our configuration options built on top of OpenAPI.
