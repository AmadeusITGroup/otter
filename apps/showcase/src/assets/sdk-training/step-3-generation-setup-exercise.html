<h1>Generate your first SDK</h1>
<h2>Command lines</h2>
<p>
  There are several command lines available to generate an SDK depending on the use cases. These cases are covered in the
  <a href="https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/otter/tree/main/packages/%40ama-sdk/schematics">documentation</a> of the package
  <b><code>@ama-sdk/schematics</code></b>.
</p>
<p>
  In this training, you will be creating a new SDK repository. To do so, you can run the command line displayed in the example on the right.
  When running this command, you should expect all of the generated files to be similar to those displayed on the right.
</p>

<!-- <h1>Generate an SDK from specifications</h1>
<h2>Generating an example SDK repository</h2>
<p>
  Let's generate an example SDK (with the default configuration - we will see how to override this configuration later on).
</p>
<p>
  Navigate to the folder where you would like to generate the SDK and then execute:
</p>
<o3r-copy-text-pres [wrap]="true" language="bash" text="yarn create @ama-sdk typescript training-sdk"></o3r-copy-text-pres>
<p>
  You will a receive a prompt asking you to specify the project name:
</p>
<o3r-copy-text-pres [wrap]="true" language="bash" text="? Project name (NPM package scope, package.json name will be @{projectName}/{packageName})?"></o3r-copy-text-pres>
<p>
  After setting the project name (for example, <b><code>training-project</code></b>), you will see the shell of your SDK repository being generated.
  This shell won't contain the specification file since we did not pass it as a parameter to the command, so it must be created manually.
  Create a specification file (for example, <b><code>openapi.yaml</code></b>) with all your API specifications, and update the <b><code>inputSpec</code></b>
  property of <b><code>openapitools.json</code></b> with the path towards your file.
</p>
<p>
  If you have an existing specification file, you have the option to pass the parameter <b><code>--spec-path [path to your openapi file]</code></b> which will
  add your specification file to the repository.
</p>
<h2>More information</h2>
<p>
  You will find more information on how to write OpenAPI specification in the <a href="https://swagger.io/specification/">documentation provided by Swagger</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Once your specification file is ready to be generated (and the <b><code>openapitools.json</code></b> file up-to-date), you can run:
</p>
<o3r-copy-text-pres [wrap]="true" language="bash" text="yarn spec:upgrade"></o3r-copy-text-pres>
<p>
  You can now notice that the <b>api</b> and <b>models/base</b> folders have been updated with the paths and definitions from your specification file.
