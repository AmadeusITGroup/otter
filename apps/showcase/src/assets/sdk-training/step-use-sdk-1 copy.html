<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>
Let's create a fetch client in your application and use it to access your API. You can get inspiration from the following code:
<pre>
  <code>
    const apiConfig: ApiClient = new ApiFetchClient(
      {
        basePath: 'https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3',
        requestPlugins: [],
        fetchPlugins: [],
        logger
      }
    );
    const api = new PetApi(apiConfig);
  </code>
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Now, you can call the api object to perform the HTTP request you look for.
Have a look at the <code>sdk/api/pet.api.ts</code> folder and look for the <code>findPetsByStatus</code>.
</p>
<p>
For this exercise, you will look for the available items and you will only show the name of the ten first pet in the allocated
space (look for the div with the id: <code>result<code>).
