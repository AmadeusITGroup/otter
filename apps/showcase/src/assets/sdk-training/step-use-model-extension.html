<h1>SDK with Model Extension</h1>
<p>
  There are certain cases in which you want to be able to extend your SDK models, and therefore ensure that revivers are generated.

<!--  Let's use the use case of the previous exercise. As mentioned, the reservation of a flight has a time limit for the payment (the order-->
<!--  is cancelled after this time). In our specifications, we defined this property as a Date object, hence relative to the user's timezone.-->
<!--</p>-->
<p>
  Let's continue with the use case of the previous exercise. In order to keep track of the user's current booking, it would be useful to generate an ID.
  To do this, we can create a new model which extends the previously generated <b><code>Flight</code></b> type.
