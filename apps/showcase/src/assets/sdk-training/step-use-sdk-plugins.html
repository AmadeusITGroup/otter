<h1>Customize your fetch client with plugins</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>
  Thanks to the <code>@ama-sdk/core</code> plugins, you can intercept the API requests and responses to transform their data or
  perform actions such as the authentication, logging etc.

  These plugins will be applied before sending all the API requests and after the reception of the responses.
</p>
<h2>Pre-requisite</h2>
- Install <code>@ama-sdk/core</code>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<p>
  In this tutorial, you will configure the <code>PetApi</code> to send an id that will be shared all over the session and log for all your reponse
  with a timestamp.
</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Create your own plugin that implements the <code>ReplyPlugin</code> interface to log the response from the server and a timestamp</p>
<p>You can inspire yourselves with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>
class LogTimestampResponsePlugin implements ReplyPlugin {
  public load<K>(context: ReplyPluginContext<K>): PluginRunner<K | undefined, V> {
    return {
      transform: (data?: V) => {
        console.log(data, new Date());
        // You could modify the response here to add new fields etc.
        return ret;
      }
    };
  }

}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Add the <code>SessionIdRequest</code> to the list of the API <code>requestPlugins</code> of your ApiFetchClient and
  your custom logging plugin to the <code>replyPlugins</code> list.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the Otter framework provides many other plugins to help you manage your authentication, your exceptions, revive your model etc.
