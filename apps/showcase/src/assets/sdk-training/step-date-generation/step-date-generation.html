<h1>SDK with Dates - Generation</h1>
<p>
  If your specification file includes dates, there are multiple options for the generation of your SDK.
</p>
<p>
  For this exercise, let's consider a specific use case. Imagine your SDK is used on a flight booking site, including international travel.
  A user who is currently in France is planning a round trip from Paris to New York City. These cities are in different timezones, which needs
  to be taken into account when the user books their flights. The outbound and return flights must be relative to the timezones of the airports.
</p>
<p>
  To do so, the dates of the flights must be of type <code>utils.DateTime</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Also, for this flight booking site, each flight has an expiration date-time for the payment, which is relative to the user's timezone.
</p>

  <i>
    This exercise should be done in your local environment. We have provided the template and the solution on the right.
    (Due to a Java constraint, you won't be able to generate your own SDK in the code editor provided on the right.)

</p>
<p>
  Let's create a specification file for our flight booking site. This SDK should contain a definition with the properties to book a flight:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Origin location code</li>
  <li>Destination location code</li>
  <li>Departure date-time</li>
  <li>Payment expiration date</li>
</ul>
<p>
  As mentioned above, the type of the departure date-time should be <code>utils.DateTime</code> after generation, which can be defined by setting the
  type of the property to <code>string</code> and adding the <code>x-local-timezone</code> vendor. Once your specification file is created, you
  can generate your SDK.

<pre class="w-100 bg-body-tertiary px-5 pre-whitespace">
  <code>
yarn schematics @ama-sdk/schematics:typescript-core --spec-path ./path/to/openapi.yaml
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  As you may notice, your date object is generated as a <code>string</code> instead of <code>Date</code>. This is normal since the
  default configuration of the SDK generator has an option <code>stringifyDate</code> that is set to <code>true</code>. To ensure that the date
  object is generated correctly, this option needs to be set to false either through the command line or in <code>openapitools.json</code>. For example:
</p>
<pre class="w-100 bg-body-tertiary px-5 pre-whitespace">
  <code>
yarn schematics @ama-sdk/schematics:typescript-core --spec-path ./path/to/openapi.yaml --global-property stringifyDate=false
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  <i><u>Note:</u> The <code>stringifyDate</code> option does not impact the generation of a <code>utils.Date</code> object.</i>
</p>
<p>
