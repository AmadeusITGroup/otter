<h1>SDK with Dates</h1>
<!-- <h2>Dates</h2> -->
<p>
  If your specification file includes dates, there are multiple options for the generation of your SDK.
</p>
<p>
  For this training, let's consider a specific use case. Imagine your SDK is used on a flight booking site, including international travel.
  A user would like to book a return trip from Paris to London. These cities are in different timezones, which needs to be taken into account
  when the user books their flights. The outbound and return flights must be relative to the timezones of the airports.
</p>
<p>
  To do so, the dates of the flights must be of type <b><code>utils.DateTime</code></b>.
</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>
  Let's create a specification file for our flight booking site. This SDK should contain a definition with the properties to book a flight:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Origin location code</li>
  <li>Destination location code</li>
  <li>Departure date-time</li>
</ul>
<p>
  As mentioned above, the type of the departure date-time should be <b><code>utils.DateTime</code></b> after generation, which can be defined by setting the
  type of the property to <b><code>string</code></b> and adding the <b><code>x-local-timezone</code></b> vendor. Once your specification file is created, you
  can generate your SDK.
</p>
<p>
  As you may notice, your date-time object isgenerated as a <b><code>string</code></b> instead of <b><code>utils.DateTime</code></b>. This is normal since the
  defaut configuration of the SDK generator has an option <b><code>stringifyDate</code></b> that is set to <b><code>true</code></b>. To ensure that the date-time
  object is generated correctly, this option needs to be set to false either through the command line or in <b><code>openapitools.json</code></b>. For example:
</p>
<pre class="w-100 bg-body-tertiary px-5 pre-whitespace">
  <code>
yarn schematics @ama-sdk/schematics:typescript-core --spec-path ./path/to/openapi.yaml --global-property stringifyDate=false
  </code>
</pre>
