<h1>SDK with Dates</h1>
<!-- <h2>Dates</h2> -->
<p>
  If your specification file includes dates, there are multiple options for the generation of your SDK.
</p>
<!--<p>-->
<!--  For this training, let's consider a specific use case. Imagine your SDK is used on a flight booking site, including international travel.-->
<!--  A user would like to book a return trip from Paris to London. These cities are in different timezones, which needs to be taken into account-->
<!--  when the user books their flights. The outbound and return flights must be relative to the timezones of the airports.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--  For this training, let's consider a specific use case. Imagine your SDK is used on a flight booking site, including international travel.-->
<!--  A user who is currently in France is planning a future trip to the United States. They have booked all of their flights but one: the return-->
<!--  flight from New York City to Paris. These cities are in different timezones, which needs to be taken into account when the user books their-->
<!--  flights. The flights must be relative to the timezones of the airports.-->

  For this training, let's consider a specific use case. Imagine your SDK is used on a flight booking site, including international travel.
  A user who is currently in France is planning a round trip from Paris to New York City. These cities are in different timezones, which needs
  to be taken into account when the user books their flights. The outbound and return flights must be relative to the timezones of the airports.
</p>
<p>
  To do so, the dates of the flights must be of type <b><code>utils.DateTime</code></b>.
</p>
<p>
  Also, for this flight booking site, each flight has an expiration date-time for the payment, which is relative to the user's timezone.
</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<h3>1. Create the SDK</h3>
<p>
  Let's create a specification file for our flight booking site. This SDK should contain a definition with the properties to book a flight:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Origin location code</li>
  <li>Destination location code</li>
  <li>Departure date-time</li>
  <li>Payment expiration date</li>
</ul>
<p>
  As mentioned above, the type of the departure date-time should be <b><code>utils.DateTime</code></b> after generation, which can be defined by setting the
  type of the property to <b><code>string</code></b> and adding the <b><code>x-local-timezone</code></b> vendor. Once your specification file is created, you
  can generate your SDK.
</p>
<p>
  As you may notice, your date-time object is generated as a <b><code>string</code></b> instead of <b><code>utils.DateTime</code></b>. This is normal since the
  defaut configuration of the SDK generator has an option <b><code>stringifyDate</code></b> that is set to <b><code>true</code></b>. To ensure that the date-time
  object is generated correctly, this option needs to be set to false either through the command line or in <b><code>openapitools.json</code></b>. For example:
</p>
<pre class="w-100 bg-body-tertiary px-5 pre-whitespace">
  <code>
yarn schematics @ama-sdk/schematics:typescript-core --spec-path ./path/to/openapi.yaml --global-property stringifyDate=false
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  Check out the solution to make sure you have generated the correct SDK locally.
</p>

<h3>2. Compare timezones</h3>
<p>
  As you can see in the solution, there is an example of a flight reservation basket using the previously generated SDK.
  Let's say that the user has selected their outbound and return flights and added them to their basket.
</p>
<p>
  The outbound trip is tomorrow at 10:00 and the return trip is one week from today at 12:00. These flights are relative
  to the timezones of the departure airports.
  You can also see a payment expiration date-time (15 minutes from now) which is relative to the user's timezone.
</p>
<p>
  You can try to modify the timezone of your environment to see how these date-times are impacted.
  <b>Make sure to reload the page when changing the timezone of your environment.</b>
</p>
<p>
  As you may notice, the departure time is not impacted while the payment expiration date-time is adapted to the timezone of
  your environment.
