# How to generate screenshots for the visual testing

To minimize discrepancies on the screenshots between different operating systems, we are generating the screenshots from inside a docker.
The procedure is the following:

1. Prerequisite: you need a docker setup (or podman), `docker` should be available globally
2. Build your application with your latest modifications `yarn nx build showcase`.
3. Serve the application on port 8080 `npx http-server ./apps/showcase/dist/browser`\
     The script will look on all local interfaces for an app running on `http://localhost:8080`
4. Make sure all your changes on the spec files are commited `git commit`\
     The project is cloned inside the docker image using `git clone` to avoid polluting the original folder.\
     Only the screenshots are exported.
5. Run the script to launch the e2e-tests inside the docker image `yarn workspace @o3r/showcase run update-screenshots`
6. You should now have the updated screenshots in your project.
