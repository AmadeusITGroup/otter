# Major 11.0 Migration guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please make sure to first follow the ["Upgrade new version guide"](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/otter/blob/main/docs/core/UPGRADE_NEW_VERSION.md) before going through these steps.

## @ama-sdk/core

- `prepareOptions` method has been removed from `ApiClient`. `getRequestOptions` should be used instead.
- To support `JSON` specification format and to remove the reference to the outdated `Swagger` format name, the file containing the current specification used to generate the SDK will be stored in a file `open-api.yaml` or `open-api.json` instead of `swagger-api.yaml`.
- To avoid interface name conflict in case of API with multiple tags (See issue [#855](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/otter/issues/855)), the API parameter object interface named with the pattern `<api-function-name>RequestData` will now be named with the `<api-function-name><api-name>RequestData`.
  - The same renaming is applied to the `enum` types part of request parameters. It changes from `<api-function-name><parameter-name>Enum` to `<api-name><api-function-name><parameter-name>Enum`.

## @o3r/schematics

- `NodePackageNgAddTask` has been removed. `setupDependencies` should be used instead
