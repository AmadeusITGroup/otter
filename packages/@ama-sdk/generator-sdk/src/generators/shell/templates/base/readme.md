### Based on Swagger spec 0.0.0

The SDK contains 2 different parts:

* Auto generated code (based on Swagger Spec)
* Specific code dedicated to this SDK

## Structure

### Auto Generated code

A main part of the SDK is automatically generated from a Swagger Spec.
The following folders contain the generated code:

* **src/api**: Containing the API calls files
* **src/models/base**: Models based of swagger definitions

The Code can be regenerated by running the following command:

```shell
yo @ama-sdk/sdk:core
```

***

### Where to put my custom code?

There are 2 places where we can add custom code:

* **src/helpers**: should contain the helper functions to transform the data.
* **src/models/custom**: should contain the models specific to this SDK (mainly the helper functions return type).

### How to extend a Model?

You can extend a base model in 3 steps:

* Redirect the default model to your override:

```typescript
// src/models/base/<model name>/index.ts
export * from "../../core/<model name>";
```

* Indicate to Swagger CodeGen that you have override the base model:

```gitignore
# in .swagger-codegen-ignore
src/models/base/<model name>/index.ts
```

* Create your core models

```typescript
// src/models/core/<model name>/index.ts
export * from "./<model name>.ts";
export * from "./<model name>.reviver.ts";
```

```typescript
// src/models/core/<model name>/<model name>.ts
import { <model name> as Base<model name> } from "../../base/<model name>/<model name>";

export interface <model name> extends BaseB<model name> {
  // Additional fields
}
```

```typescript
// src/models/core/<model name>/<model name>.reviver.ts
import { yourFunction } from "../../../helpers/<model name>";
import { revive<model name> as Base<model name> } from "../../base/<model name>/<model name>.reviver";
import { <model name> } from "./<model name>";

import {Reviver, utils} from "@ama-sdk/core";

export function revive<model name><T extends <model name> = <model name>>(data: any, dictionary?: any) {
  // TODO: use BaseRevive<T> when ready
  const revivedData: T | undefined = Base<model name>(data, dictionary) as T | undefined;

  if (!revivedData) { return ; }

  if (!revivedData.yourField) {
    revivedData.yourField = yourFunction(revivedData);
  }

  return revivedData;
}
```

## Commands

Some commands are provided to keep your SDK up-to-date.

### Generate SDK from a Swagger specification

```shell
yarn swagger:regen
```

### Run Unit Tests

You can build and run UT with:

```shell
yarn test
```

## Vendor extensions

These are some of the available configurations using vendor extensions in the swagger spec

### Manage timezone in date

In order to add the timezone to your timestamp property you can add the x-date-timezone extension in your yaml, for example:

```yaml
properties:
  timestamp:
    title: timestamp
    description: >-
      Timestamp when event is triggered. UTC time (server time), with a
      format similar to yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.sTZD. Refer to the pattern
    type: string
    format: date-time
    x-date-timezone:
      description: If this vendor extension is present send dates with the timezone
    pattern: >-
      ^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}T[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}.[0-9]{1,3}([Z]|([+][0-9]{2}:?[0-9]{2}$))
    example: '2013-12-31T19:20:30.45+01:00'
```
