        Determine the configuration to use for subsequent API calls.

        The endpoint determines the configuration to use based on a set of
        business rules defined in a rules engine.

        The facts used by the rules engine are key value pairs (KVPs) provided
        in the body of the request.

        The end point returns the point of sale id that should be used to build
        the new authorization header.
