## Description

[![Stable Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@o3r/core)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@o3r/core)
[![Bundle Size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/min/@o3r/core?color=green)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@o3r/core)

This module gathers the core of the [Otter Framework](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/otter).
It is the foundation for all the packages (interfaces, core helpers) and contains schematics to generate your components/services etc.

Otter is a Framework providing a set of tools to accelerate the development of a prod ready application via several in-app features and developer tooling.
This includes a toolbox to customize, administrate and debug an application at runtime.

## Get Started

The application will contain the minimum setup to follow the otter recommendations and to activate the features requested
during the installation of the `@o3r/core`.

### Required environment

* **Git** : [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/)
* **NodeJs 18.x** : [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/)
* **Yarn** : [https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/](https://yarnpkg.com/)

**Yarn** can be installed directly using NPM:

```shell
# Installing yarn
npm install --global yarn
```

### Creating a new Otter application

```shell
# Create new application
npm create @o3r my-project
# Or
yarn create @o3r my-project
```

### Adding Material design theming

```shell
# Add Material Design
yarn ng add @angular/material
# ? Choose a prebuilt theme name, or "custom" for a custom theme: Indigo/Pink
# ? Set up HammerJS for gesture recognition? Yes
# ? Set up browser animations for Angular Material? Yes
```

Then uncomment the following lines in the `src/styles.scss` file to apply the Otter theming to Material Design components :

```scss
@include mat.core();
@include mat.all-component-typographies($typography);
@include mat.all-component-themes($mat-theme);
```

## Generators

Otter framework provides a set of code generators based on [angular schematics](https://angular.io/guide/schematics).

## Create your own Otter compatible module

You can refer to the [module documentation](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/otter/tree/main/docs/core/MODULE.md) to create an Otter compatible module.

## Presets

To accelerate the setup of repositories, different `presets` are provided that will chain the add of different modules.
Today the following presets are available.

### Preset Basic

This preset is the default one, it does not add any additional modules.

### Preset CMS

Will add all the modules allowing the allowing the full managing of an application by the CMS.
It includes the following modules:

* @o3r/localization
* @o3r/styling
* @o3r/components
* @o3r/configuration
* @o3r/dynamic-content
* @o3r/rules-engine

### Preset All

Will add all official modules provided by the Otter Framework.
Currently the list of modules is the following:

* @o3r/analytics
* @o3r/apis-manager
* @o3r/application
* @o3r/components
* @o3r/configuration
* @o3r/dynamic-content
* @o3r/eslint-config-otter
* @o3r/eslint-plugin
* @o3r/forms
* @o3r/localization
* @o3r/logger
* @o3r/rules-engine
* @o3r/store-sync
* @o3r/stylelint-plugin
* @o3r/styling

## External (Custom) Preset

The preset mechanism is supporting, via the `--external-preset` option, presets defined by module providers themself.

The modules can be regrouped in custom Presets by following the next steps:

* Adding a **keyword**, in the module *package.json*'s `keywords` field, following the pattern `otter-preset-<my-preset>`.
* The module needs to be published to a public (or private) NPM Registry.
* The package's scope should be whitelisted, via a Pull Request, in the following [OTTER_MODULE_SUPPORTED_SCOPES constant](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/otter/blob/main/packages/@o3r/schematics/src/modules/modules.constants.ts).

> [!TIP]
> Get more information regarding the **Otter Modules** in the [Module Documentation](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/otter/blob/main/docs/core/MODULE.md).
