# Migration scripts

You can place here your migration scripts to document the breaking changes in your metadata.

The versioned files should be placed in `./src` folder.

Running the `aggregate-migration-scripts` command will create the `./dist` which will also include the migration-scripts from libraries.

Please refer to [the documentation on CMS Adapters](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/otter/blob/main/docs/cms-adapters/CMS_ADAPTERS.md).
