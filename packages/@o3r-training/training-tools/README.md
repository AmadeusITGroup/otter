This module provides basic utilities to use the Otter training such as:
- A code source extractor to generate JSON files compatible with [WebContainer](https://webcontainers.io/guides/working-with-the-file-system).

## How to install

```shell
ng add @o3r-training/training-tools
```

## How to use
You can use the extractor via the CLI to extract a folder from your file system:
```shell
o3r-extract-folder-structure --files \".\path-to-source-folder\" -o webcontainer-folder-structure.js
```
You can also use the `getFilesTree` function with the `WebContainer` file system to serialize its tree:
```typescript
const serializedFiles = await getFilesTree([{
    path,
    isDir: true
  }], instance.fs as FileSystem, EXCLUDED_FILES_OR_DIRECTORY);
```

## Description

This is a technical package to be used as dependency by [Otter modules](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/otter/tree/main/docs/core/MODULE.md) providing tools to used in the development of Otter training.
